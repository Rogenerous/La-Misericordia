  <p>First of all, thank you for reading this. I know I don't update alot and right now there's only flora and fauna showing without any actual "progress". To be honest, this will take a long time. I have the greatest plans and thankfully I'm still young-ish. </p>
  <p>Right now I have to get and keep my priorities straight. Moving here and buying the property has cost me alot. Ofcourse I'm taking care of the plants like the beautiful Mirabilis you can see under the Flora tab. But I will need to generate some income before I can start investing in bigger projects.</p>
  <p>Luckily I have another aspiration. That is anything cyber related basicly. Right now I'm following an online study which will hopefully generate some income within the next couple of years. Building this website is also part of the hobby to practice with some coding.</p>
  <p>That doesn't mean I can't do anything without a budget. I'm busy making a hiking trail in the mountains on the property.</p>

  <p>This picture doesn't really show well how high it actually is. I mean, just look at this view.</p>

  <p>Right now it's a steep climb. The animals have made a start by making a gametrail but I did have to use both hands and feet at some places to escalate. My plan is to build a road that's safe and accessible. Ofcourse it will be breathtaking in more than one way haha. Also alongside I discovered a drinking spot for wild animals.</p>

  <p>Ofcourse it is not my intention to disturb wildlife. I don't expect many human visitors who will walk here regularly but to be sure there will be other paths which don't come too close to this spot but will still give the oppertunity to watch from afar. A family member already had the great idea of setting up a small shelter to spot wildlife without interfering. And who know, maybe some wildcameras. But that's another budget thing haha.</p>
  <p>With that being said, if any of you reading this have some nice ideas. Feel free to come by and maybe put in some work. This is not neccesary ofcourse. You're also welcome without any ideas and just to relax a bit. While this website is publicly accessible, I expect the visitors just to be either friends or family. So the Contact page will probably just be a placeholder for the next couple of years. Or maybe never get used at all if I will need to build another website for whatever reason haha.</p>
  <p>Once again, thank you for reading. And who knows, maybe we will see eachother at <a href="index.html">La Misericordia</a>. Have a great day!</p>
