    <p>
      This hornet was crushed by the author. He assumed that it was the notorious hornet that kills all bees. Although the European hornet does occasionally hunt a bee, these are not the mass murderers that pose the real problem in Catalonia. That honor belongs to the Asian hornets. They can be recognized by their much darker thorax and abdomen, which is mostly black with a single broad orange band. They are also much smaller. The European variety is large and has a yellow abdomen with dark patterns. These no longer need to be killed because they also hunt mosquitoes and wasps! A thousand apologies, and thankfully you died for science, as this photo made identification possible.
