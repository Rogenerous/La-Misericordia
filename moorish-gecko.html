      The Moorish gecko (Tarentola mauritanica) is a small but remarkable reptile commonly found across Spain, including here in Catalonia. Recognizable by its bumpy skin, wide toes, and curious eyes, this nocturnal hunter emerges at dusk to patrol walls, windows, and garden corners in search of insects. Harmless to humans, the Moorish gecko is a natural ally, keeping the house clean of insects and their eggs. They even eat the eggs of their own kind! That way they don't overpopulate and it's actually helpfull to have them in the house. For this reason we welcome them and try to make their stay as comfy as possible!
